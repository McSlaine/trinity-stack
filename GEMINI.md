## Autonomous Operation Guidelines

- **Independent Testing:** I will proactively use `web_fetch` to gather information and test functionalities independently, especially when an active token is available. I will only request your input or intervention when it's essential for progress or verification.

## Cashflow Trends AI ‚Äì Strategic Development Plan (Enhanced Edition)

This document outlines the architectural evolution from a proof-of-concept into a robust, multi-tenant financial intelligence platform with real-time sync and AI-driven insights.

---

## Phase 1: Local Data Cache & Background Sync ‚úÖ

**Goal:** Decouple UI from MYOB latency, enable scalable architecture for analysis.

- [x] Local PostgreSQL mirror of MYOB data (invoices, bills, GST)
- [x] REST API endpoints: `/sync/:companyId`, `/sync-status`, `/sync-log`
- [x] Per-company sync isolation (resilient error handling)
- [x] Timeout logic (Promise.race)
- [x] Crash protection (uncaughtException, unhandledRejection)
- [x] Sync diagnostics via `syncProgressMap`
- [x] Error logging to `sync_log`
- [ ] Pull 2 years of data on initial sync
- [ ] Redis fallback demo data for new users while sync completes
- [ ] Queue-based sync (RabbitMQ or similar) to handle load & rate limits
- [ ] Serve default ABS-based industry templates in UI pre-sync
- [ ] Display ‚Äúsync in progress‚Äù state and estimated duration to user

---

## Phase 2: Deepen Financial Data Scope

**Goal:** Expand local mirror with high-value datasets to support true financial intelligence.

- [ ] Sync Chart of Accounts
- [ ] Sync P&L Statements
- [ ] Sync Balance Sheets
- [ ] Sync Customer & Supplier records

---

## Phase 3: Semantic AI Advisor (Post-Sync)

**Goal:** Transform AI into a contextual financial assistant.

- [ ] Integrate Pinecone (or Weaviate) as VectorDB
- [ ] Generate vector embeddings of financial data via Sentence Transformers
- [ ] Semantic query engine with relevant retrieval + prompt injection
- [ ] Enable strategic queries: forecasting, trends, anomaly detection
- [ ] Build prompt-engineering layer to support cashflow logic tree

---

## Phase 4: Cost Optimisation & Monitoring

**Goal:** Minimise cloud/API costs, add internal observability.

- [ ] Redis cache for high-frequency queries (semantic + sync)
- [ ] Claude/Grok/OpenAI hybrid query routing via LangChain rules
- [ ] Batch nightly sync + embedding (lower cost)
- [ ] Internal AI mentor: alerts for spikes, failed syncs, high costs
- [ ] Cost dashboard (queries/user/API breakdowns)
- [ ] Add disclaimers for seasonal outliers and AI advice boundaries

---

## Phase 5: Tooling Migration (Gemini CLI ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ Advanced AI Ops)

**Goal:** Migrate away from Gemini CLI toward a multi-agent model.

- [ ] Regenerate MYOB sync with Copilot/Claude for benchmarking
- [ ] Update AI routing to support anomaly classification/escalation
- [ ] Switch code completion tools (test accuracy and reliability)

---

## Phase 6: Marketing & Onboarding

**Goal:** Build automated lead gen and guided onboarding.

- [ ] Integrate ScoreApp or equivalent for onboarding quiz funnel
- [ ] Auto-categorise company type post-sync using transaction analysis
- [ ] Store guessed business type in `user_profile`
- [ ] Personalise UI and AI prompts per industry
- [ ] GDPR-compliant consent for analysis
- [ ] Email signup/lead flow via Nodemailer + Scorecard webhook

---

## Scalability Forecast

- PostgreSQL (DigitalOcean Managed): $500‚Äì$1000/month (100 users)
- Pinecone (VectorDB): $10‚Äì$50/month
- Claude/OpenAI API costs: $100‚Äì$300/month (post-routing)
- Redis: $50/month (demo + cache)
- Total Estimated Cost @100 users: ~$1,000‚Äì$1,500/month

## Debugging Principles

- Never retry schema fixes if the same table/column has already been added.
- Always check for the presence of columns using SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns...
- Do not attempt sync unless all DB migrations are complete and schema is validated.
- Use crash.log ONLY to identify new problems. Do not overwrite fixes without confirmation.



## üìå Project Name: Cashflow Trends AI

### üß† Purpose
Semantic financial analysis tool that syncs MYOB company file data into a PostgreSQL + Pinecone stack, allowing natural language queries about transactions, cashflow, bills, and GST status.

---

## ‚úÖ Current System Overview

### üóÉÔ∏è Backend Stack
- Node.js server
- PostgreSQL (via DigitalOcean Managed DB)
- Pinecone Vector DB
- MYOB API Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4 API

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend Stack
- Vanilla JS
- Dashboard page served from server
- AI Assistant input box for natural language query to `/vector-query/:companyId`

---

## üîÅ Sync Pipeline (sync.js)

### Functionality
- Fetches data from MYOB using `myobAdapter.js`
- Inserts into `bills`, `invoices`, `gst_activity`, etc.
- Pushes structured text + metadata to Pinecone with `pushToVectorDB()`

### Expected Metadata in Pinecone Vectors
- `type` (e.g., invoice, bill, payment)
- `amount`
- `status`
- `date`
- `original_text`

---

## üì° API Endpoints

### POST `/api/sync/:companyId`
Triggers sync of MYOB data for given company file.

### POST `/vector-query/:companyId`
User enters query (e.g. "What are my top expenses?") ‚Üí GPT turns it into embedding ‚Üí Pinecone vector similarity ‚Üí Top K matches returned.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING: GET `/api/sync/status/:companyId`
> Must be implemented. The Dashboard JS polls this endpoint for real-time sync status.

Proposed implementation (Node.js):
```js
app.get('/api/sync/status/:companyFileId', async (req, res) => {
  const { companyFileId } = req.params;
  try {
    const { rows } = await query('SELECT * FROM sync_progress WHERE company_file_id = $1', [companyFileId]);
    if (rows.length === 0) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Not found' });
    res.json(rows[0]);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Known Bugs & Issues

### 1. `initializeChat is not defined`
- JS error in `dashboard.js:145`
- Solution: Either define this dummy function:
```js
function initializeChat() { console.log("Chat placeholder"); }
```
or wire in actual chat module if implemented elsewhere.

### 2. Vector DB empty (Pinecone)
- No embeddings returned until sync works
- Confirm `pushToVectorDB()` is called inside `syncCompany()`

### 3. `company_files` table missing `uri` column
- Already patched in `db.sql`:
```sql
ALTER TABLE company_files ADD COLUMN uri TEXT;
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Gemini Prompt Cheatsheet

### ‚úÖ To fix missing `/sync/status` endpoint:
```
Add a GET route `/api/sync/status/:companyFileId` that queries sync_progress by company_file_id and returns status JSON.
```

### ‚úÖ To fix chat init crash:
```
Ensure initializeChat() is defined before calling it in dashboard.js:145.

Sync Progress Bug ÔøΩ Resolved
Issue:
UI displayed sync status as (0/0) with no progress, even when backend processed records correctly.

Cause:
In lib/sync.js, the final UPDATE sync_progress query did not update processed_items and total_items.
This caused the frontend to see zero values, wiping out any progress visually.

Fix:
Modified the final update to include:

 
processed_items = total_items
This ensures accurate display of sync completion in the UI.

Updated query (in lib/sync.js):

js
 
await query(`
  UPDATE sync_progress 
  SET status = $1, 
      processed_items = total_items, 
      details = CASE WHEN $1 = 'Completed' THEN NULL ELSE details END 
  WHERE company_file_id = $2
`, [overallStatus, companyId]);
Outcome:
UI now reflects correct sync completion values. Issue closed.

##  Debugging Protocol

**Problem Summary:**
- **Nginx is dead**: This is the root cause for HTTPS (port 443) connections failing.
- **PM2 is running**: The Node.js application is managed by PM2 and works correctly on port 3000.
- **Debugging Confusion**: Previous debugging attempts created confusion by using `npm` to manage processes instead of `pm2`.

**Operational Rules:**
1.  **Always use PM2**: The Node.js application must be managed with PM2 (`pm2 restart app_name`, `pm2 logs`, etc.).
2.  **Do NOT use npm directly**: Avoid using `npm start` or `npm stop` as it conflicts with the PM2/Nginx setup.
3.  **Check Nginx first**: If the `https://` URL is down, check the Nginx service status (`systemctl status nginx`) before debugging the Node.js application.
