# MYOB OAuth Critical Issue - Solved

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

The problem is a **caching and propagation delay issue within MYOB's authentication system**.

1.  **Initial State (Wrong Redirect)**: MYOB's servers had cached the user's consent to the old, now-deleted application. When the OAuth flow was initiated with the new client ID, MYOB's system ignored the new configuration and defaulted to the redirect URI from the old, cached consent.

2.  **Current State ("invalid_client" error)**: After deleting the old application, MYOB's authorization server is now in an inconsistent state. It can no longer find the old application it was trying to default to, resulting in the "invalid_client" error, even though your new client ID is correct and active in the developer portal.

The "Invalid state parameter" error from direct URL testing was a red herring, simply indicating that your application's session was missing the state variable, not that MYOB validated the client ID.

## 2. The Definitive Solution: Create a New, Clean Application

Waiting for a propagation delay is not a reliable strategy. The most effective way to resolve this is to force a completely clean state by creating a new application in the MYOB Developer Portal.

### Action Plan

1.  **Create a New MYOB App**:
    *   Log in to the MYOB Developer Portal.
    *   Create a brand new application. Name it something distinct to avoid confusion, for example: **"Cashflow AI (July 2025)"**.
    *   Set the **Redirect URI** to the correct, current URL: `https://cashflowtrends.ai/auth/callback`
    *   A new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be generated.

2.  **Update Application Environment**:
    *   Open your application's `.env` file.
    *   Replace the existing `MYOB_CLIENT_ID` and `MYOB_CLIENT_SECRET` values with the **new credentials** from the application you just created.

3.  **Restart the Server**:
    *   Use the correct process manager command to restart your application and ensure it loads the new environment variables:
        ```bash
        pm2 restart <your_app_name>
        ```

4.  **Test the Login Flow**:
    *   **Crucially**, clear your browser's cache and cookies for both `cashflowtrends.ai` and `myob.com` to prevent any old session data from interfering.
    *   Navigate to `https://cashflowtrends.ai/auth/login` and attempt the login process again.

This will establish a completely fresh OAuth flow with no legacy settings or cached consents, forcing MYOB to use the correct redirect URI.

## 3. Understanding the Ory Codes

The `ory_ac_` codes are not an error. Ory is the identity provider that MYOB uses for its modern authentication backend. Your application should treat these as standard authorization codes. The previous issue was not about the *type* of code, but that the code was being sent to the *wrong redirect URI*. The solution above will fix the redirect URI problem.
