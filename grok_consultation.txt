TRINITY STACK CONSULTATION REQUEST - Cashflow Dashboard Sync Issue

Problem: Dashboard stuck in "Syncing Data..." state, never displays financial data.

Context from ISSUE_ESCALATION.md:
- Previous debugging attempts failed and were reverted
- Backend appears to provide data but frontend won't render
- Suspected issues: API timeouts, frontend parsing errors, race conditions
- Fake data seeding still didn't work, indicating frontend rendering issue

Investigation Options:
1. API Endpoint Validation: Test /api/dashboard-summary/:companyFileId endpoints
2. Frontend Data Parsing: Debug company-file.js loadDashboard() function  
3. Sync Process Health: Verify sync completion vs detection issue
4. Database Layer: Check if data is actually being stored post-sync

Question: What investigation sequence would you recommend for highest success probability?

Current system status:
- Node.js server running via PM2
- PostgreSQL database connected
- MYOB OAuth integration working
- Frontend gets stuck in loading state

Request: Please provide strategic approach with reasoning for investigation order.
