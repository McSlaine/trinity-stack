# Issue Escalation: Dashboard Not Loading

**Problem:** The company dashboard at `/company-file.html` is stuck in a perpetual "Syncing Data..." state and does not display any financial data.

**Root Cause:** There is a persistent, unidentified issue that is preventing the frontend from correctly fetching and rendering the data from the backend, even though the backend *appears* to be providing the data.

**Summary of Failed Attempts:**

1.  **Initial Sync Failures:** The initial data sync process was repeatedly failing due to a combination of API timeouts and incorrect API requests for the Profit & Loss report.
2.  **Fragile Sync Logic:** The sync process was not resilient and would fail completely if any single part of the sync failed.
3.  **Incorrect Frontend Parsing:** The frontend script was not correctly handling the data structures returned from the backend, causing silent JavaScript errors.
4.  **Database Connection Issues:** The database connection was suspected, but a direct test proved it was working correctly.
5.  **SQL Query Errors:** The SQL queries in the `dashboard-summary` endpoint were suspected, but detailed logging did not reveal any obvious errors.
6.  **Race Conditions:** The frontend logic was refactored multiple times to handle potential race conditions where data was being requested before the sync was complete.
7.  **Fake Data Seeding:** The database was seeded with fake data to isolate the frontend, but the page still did not load correctly, indicating a fundamental issue in the frontend rendering logic.

**Current Status:**

*   All changes made during the debugging session have been reverted to restore the application to its last known stable state.
*   The root cause appears to be a subtle logic error in `company-file.js` that prevents it from correctly rendering the data, even when the data is present.

**Recommendation:**

A fresh perspective is needed. I recommend a full, end-to-end review of the data flow, from the `syncCompanyData` function in `server.js` to the `loadDashboard` function in `company-file.js`. The issue is likely a subtle logic error that I have been unable to identify.
